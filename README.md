Enzyme Reaction Rate Estimation with Matlab                                                                                 
plot_script.m is plot data from data variable , its first column is subsrate concentration and second one is enzyme activity. 
mm_est.m is a function that estimates Km and Vmax values of enzyme-subrate complex.
